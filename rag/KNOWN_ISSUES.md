# Known Issues and Workarounds

This document tracks known limitations and issues in RAG-CLI v2.0, along with their workarounds and resolution status.

## Active Issues

### Marketplace Cache Finalization Error on Windows (FIXED)

**Status:** Fixed in latest commit
**Severity:** High (prevented marketplace installation)
**Affected Versions:** v2.0.0 (before fix)
**Platform:** Windows only
**Component:** Lifecycle hooks and path resolution

#### Issue Description

When installing RAG-CLI via Claude Code marketplace on Windows, the installation would complete but the marketplace cache finalization would fail with:

```
Warning: Failed to load marketplace 'rag-cli': Failed to finalize marketplace cache.
Please manually delete the directory at C:\Users\SharmilaB\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\rag-cli
if it exists and try again.

Technical details: EPERM, Permission denied: \\?\C:\Users\SharmilaB\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\rag-cli
```

**Symptoms:**
- Plugin installs successfully
- Post-install hook completes without errors
- Marketplace cache cannot be finalized
- Windows EPERM (Permission denied) error on marketplace directory
- Warning appears every time marketplace is loaded

#### Root Cause

The lifecycle hooks (post_install, pre_update, post_update) were inadvertently creating file handle locks on the marketplace cache directory:

1. Claude Code framework extracts plugin to marketplace cache at `C:\Users\SharmilaB\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\rag-cli`
2. Post-install hook runs from this temporary location
3. Hook imports modules that use PathResolver and path_utils
4. PathResolver checks for marketplace directory and finds it (since hook is running from there)
5. Python creates singleton instances that hold references to marketplace directory
6. Hook completes but Python interpreter still has file handles open
7. Framework tries to finalize (rename/move) marketplace cache directory
8. On Windows, rename fails with EPERM because Python still holds file handles

**Key Technical Details:**
- Path resolution code in `src/rag_cli/core/path_resolver.py:61-63` checked marketplace directory
- Hook path utilities in `src/rag_cli_plugin/hooks/path_utils.py:78-79` also checked marketplace
- Windows file locking is stricter than Unix/Linux
- Directory rename requires exclusive access to all files within

#### Solution Implemented

Multiple defensive measures were implemented to prevent file locks:

**1. Skip Marketplace During Lifecycle Hooks** (path_resolver.py, path_utils.py)
- Added `CLAUDE_LIFECYCLE_HOOK` environment variable check
- Skip marketplace directory entirely when variable is set to "true"
- Prevents PathResolver from creating references to marketplace cache

**2. Set Environment Variable in Lifecycle Config** (lifecycle.json)
- All lifecycle hooks now set `CLAUDE_LIFECYCLE_HOOK=true`
- Applies to post_install, pre_update, and post_update hooks

**3. Removed Module Imports from Verification** (installer.py)
- Removed `from rag_cli.core import vector_store, embeddings` imports
- Removed `from rag_cli_plugin.mcp import unified_server` imports
- Verification now only checks directory structure, not module imports
- Module imports verified at runtime instead of install time

**4. Explicit Resource Cleanup** (installer.py, updater.py)
- Added `cleanup_resources()` function to both lifecycle modules
- Forces garbage collection to release file handles
- Clears PathResolver singleton instances
- Runs in `finally` block to ensure execution

**5. Added CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT Support** (path_resolver.py)
- PathResolver now checks `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable
- This variable is set by Claude Code to the actual installation directory
- Ensures hooks use installation directory, not marketplace cache

#### Files Modified

- `src/rag_cli_plugin/lifecycle/installer.py:166-206` - Removed module imports, added cleanup
- `src/rag_cli_plugin/lifecycle/updater.py:258-314` - Added cleanup function
- `src/rag_cli/core/path_resolver.py:40-92` - Skip marketplace during lifecycle hooks
- `src/rag_cli_plugin/hooks/path_utils.py:75-101` - Skip marketplace during lifecycle hooks
- `.claude-plugin/lifecycle.json:10-46` - Added CLAUDE_LIFECYCLE_HOOK environment variable

#### Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. On Windows, install via marketplace (simulated or actual)
2. Check that no EPERM errors appear
3. Verify marketplace cache directory can be renamed after hook completes
4. Confirm plugin installs and functions correctly

**Expected Results:**
- Post-install hook completes successfully
- No permission errors during marketplace finalization
- Plugin loads without warnings
- All functionality works as expected

#### Prevention

This fix prevents similar issues in the future by:
- Explicitly avoiding marketplace cache in all path resolution
- Using environment variables to signal lifecycle hook context
- Implementing defensive cleanup even if not strictly necessary
- Documenting the Windows file locking behavior

**Best Practices for Lifecycle Hooks:**
- Never import modules that use singleton pattern with file I/O
- Always clean up resources in finally block
- Use environment variables to communicate context
- Prefer environment variable resolution over directory walking
- Test on Windows where file locking is stricter

### PostToolUse Hook Disabled (Claude Code Framework Bug)

**Status:** Workaround implemented
**Severity:** Medium
**Affected Versions:** v2.0.0+
**Component:** `.claude-plugin/hooks.json` - PostToolUse hook

#### Issue Description

The PostToolUse hook (`response-post.py`) is designed to add inline citations to Claude's responses when RAG context is used. However, due to a JSON parsing bug in the Claude Code plugin framework, this hook causes response processing failures when enabled.

**Symptoms:**
- Responses fail to display correctly
- JSON parsing errors in hook output
- Citations not appearing in responses

#### Root Cause

The Claude Code plugin framework has a bug in how it handles JSON output from PostToolUse hooks. The framework expects a specific JSON structure but fails to properly parse the modified response object, causing the entire hook chain to fail.

**Technical Details:**
- Hook location: `src/rag_cli_plugin/hooks/response-post.py`
- Expected functionality: Inject citation markers `[1][2]` into responses
- Failure point: JSON serialization/deserialization in hook output processing
- Framework issue: Claude Code's hook result parsing does not handle nested metadata correctly

#### Workaround

The hook is currently **disabled** in `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src/rag_cli_plugin/hooks/response-post.py"],
          "name": "response-post",
          "priority": 80,
          "enabled": false,
          "description": "Adds inline citations to Claude responses when RAG context is used (DISABLED: Claude Code bug with JSON parsing)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Impact of Workaround:**
- RAG functionality works normally
- Context is properly retrieved and injected into prompts
- Claude generates accurate responses with RAG context
- **Missing:** Inline citation markers in responses (e.g., `[1][2]`)
- **Missing:** Source attribution at the end of responses

**Alternative for Citations:**
Users can manually request citation information by asking:
```
What sources did you use for that answer?
```

The UserPromptSubmit hook still logs retrieved documents, so citation information is available in logs at `logs/rag_cli.log`.

#### Resolution Plan

1. **Short-term (Current):** Keep hook disabled, system remains stable
2. **Medium-term:** Monitor Claude Code framework updates for JSON parsing fixes
3. **Long-term:** Re-enable hook once framework bug is resolved

**Potential Fix Approaches:**
- Wait for Claude Code framework update (recommended)
- Implement alternative citation method via UserPromptSubmit hook
- Use response metadata instead of modifying response text
- Create custom MCP server endpoint for citation retrieval

#### Testing

To test if the issue is resolved in future Claude Code versions:

1. Update Claude Code to latest version
2. Enable the hook in `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`:
   ```json
   "enabled": true
   ```
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Test with a RAG-enhanced query:
   ```
   /rag-retrieve --query "test query"
   ```
5. Check if citations appear correctly in the response
6. Monitor logs for JSON parsing errors

#### Related Files

- Hook implementation: `src/rag_cli_plugin/hooks/response-post.py`
- Configuration: `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`
- Test: `tests/test_hooks/test_response_post.py`
- Documentation: `docs/hooks/response-post.md`

#### Additional Notes

- The hook code is fully functional and tested in isolation
- Unit tests pass when run outside the Claude Code framework
- Issue is specific to the plugin framework's hook processing
- No data loss or corruption occurs with the workaround
- System stability and performance are unaffected

## Resolved Issues

### Import Structure Changes (v1.x to v2.0)

**Status:** Resolved in v2.0.0
**Resolution:** Complete restructuring to dual-package layout

The v1.x import structure was inconsistent. This was resolved in v2.0 by:
- Creating `rag_cli` core library package
- Creating `rag_cli_plugin` plugin package
- Updating all imports to use new structure
- Providing migration scripts in `scripts/utils/`

See `docs/V2_RESTRUCTURING_SUMMARY.md` for details.

## Future Enhancements

These are not bugs but planned features that will address limitations:

### 1. Advanced Citation System

Once PostToolUse hook is working:
- Sentence-level citation mapping using embeddings
- Smart citation placement (avoid over-citing)
- Interactive citation exploration in responses
- Clickable source references

### 2. Persistent Hook State Management

Improve hook state coordination:
- Shared state between hooks via Redis/file cache
- Better session context preservation
- Cross-hook data flow optimization

### 3. Hook Error Recovery

Enhanced error handling:
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when hooks fail
- Better error reporting to users
